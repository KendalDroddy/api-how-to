          <p>The National Park Service function as an agency of the US government. 
          This agency is most commonly associated with its role in managing the nation's
          59 national parks. These parks, each magnificent in its own way, draw thousands
          to millions of visitors each year. With so much interest, a convenient way to store
          data about these parks was much needed, hence the NPS Data API. This API stores
          important information about each national park ranging from campground availability, current park alerts, and visitor center locations.</p>

          <p class="pt-2">The internet has made finding information, about any and everything, incredibly easy. In fact, people have more information at their fingertips now than at any point in history. Generally, this information is found by utilizing a search engine or browsings a website. But websites also provide information in ways that not nearly as many people know about.</p>
          <p>Utilizing what is known as an Application Programming Interface, or API for short, users can access troves of data that's othewise hidden to the naked eye. This is done by calling specific methods established by the website which allows this data to be retreived from their web servers. In this manner, we will utilize the National Park Services Data API to fetch data from their servers!</p>
